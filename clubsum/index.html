<p>​	▾	Main Summary</p>
<p>​		•	The HFI Programming Club is an ambitious and academically achieving club that have been and will be thriving in the rich and opulent soil of HFI. Since the initial imagination and creation of it, it has been a place of education and higher development of academic skill, it is safe to say: this administration has not failed to any standard. In this year, despite difficulties in both human resources, school support, and the unfortunate occurrence of COVID-19, this club has continued, as always, to deliver, perhaps even more prolific and bountiful than previous years.</p>
<p>​		•	In this administration, there are two presidents: Zhong Dazhi and Chen Marin.</p>
<p>​		•	In this administration, there are two presidents: Zhong Dazhi and Chen Marin. These two presidents both managing separate but integral roles in the club. Dazhi&rsquo;s role is primarily academic and major managing, from the coding, teaching of the students, to the planning and supervising of project flows, Dazhi&rsquo;s role extensively guides the flow of the club. While Marin guides, teaches, and inspires the students, as well as planning, meeting, and managing relations with other clubs and programming clubs in other schools.</p>
<p>​		•	There are 27 club members in the HFI Programming Club, 8 of which are core members. Normal club members participate in club meetings, engage in club projects, but have limited ability to code, and are learning throughout the year. Core members, however, engage in all projects, and provide major contributions to the codebase, and spend sufficient time in development.</p>
<p>​		•	Two major routes have been formulated in the club, one of which is project development, while another is academic competitions, both having people pursuing, but the major route that this club is going for is project development. The philosophy behind this is that only throughout hand-to-hand developing, can members truly develop a passion, and obtain experience in the vast field of programming. While pursuing academic wins are thrilling and enthralling, and can obtain knowledge more efficiently than otherwise, it is only for die-hard lovers, and only core members pursue such achievements.</p>
<p>​		•	In project development, we achieved many results, often making</p>
<p>​		•	In a more statistical sense, sinked in project development are more than 30 meetings consisting orienting, coding, and discussing projects, 100+ man hours put in development, and at least 40 man hours from the two presidents preparing and coding for meetings and projects.</p>
<p>​		•	Academically, we stay straight on the road that our past precedents paved, yet with little modifications and renovations during. Throughout the year, we have accomplished multiple projects, numerous meetings and lecturing lessons, and attended academic contests. Yet, we marched into previously untapped grounds, seeking novelty in &ldquo;Arduino&rdquo; microprocessors, with the goodwill that it would bring lifeblood to our club — to our relief, it did.</p>
<p>​		•	Yet, despite these achievements, we still find inspiration from successes and failures from ourselves and others, and plan in the next year to put forth a stronger call for members, a more down-to-earth style, and more school-wide activities that people with less computer programming ability can partake. We hope that with more time and delicate planning, we can withhold more attention and achieve much, much more.</p>
<p>​		•	In summary, with proud results but also deliberate internal and external reflection, we march into the next year with confidence and preparation.</p>
<p>​		•	A list of our achievements is listed below.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, us being coders that seek truth in actual development and constructive participation, do not dwell on useless and formalist activities such as photo-shooting every single meeting, so forgive me when photographic documentation is rare.</p>
<p>​	▾	Major and Minor Events</p>
<p>​		▾	Academic competition preparation and attending</p>
<p>​			▾	Overview</p>
<p>​				•	The two major events (USACO and ACSL) were held mainly during the COVID-19 quarantine, in zoom meetings. We aim from the meetings to make more people love the subject, and score a higher score in these academically challenging contests. Most importantly, we wish that through the challenges, people would gradually love the subject, just as I do.</p>
<p>​				•	Yet, our adherence in exams and contests is not yet high enough, many other schools have similar programs, and have bi-weekly mocks. Thus, to address the problem, we plan to add a division that aims more on exams, with the past and present presidents monitoring and tutoring. I believe HFIP next year would be more academically amazing!</p>
<p>​			▾	ACSL preparation and attending (8 meetings)</p>

        alt="download-2"/></p>
<p>​				•	ACSL competition had four separate sections, and our meeting of five, <strong>(Dazhi, Marin, Jason, Charlie, Peter),</strong> prepared for each, and attended each (which is 4*2 <strong>8 meetings in total)</strong>. The dates are: <strong>19th, 20th,&amp; 21st December, 5th&amp;8th March, 17th&amp;22nd March, and 23rd&amp;25th April. (Including test dates)</strong></p>
<p>​				•	Meetings from before the holiday (19th, 20th,&amp; 21st December) are held at 603, at 7:00-9:30pm. And meetings after the holiday are less time consuming, and only role is to share questions and resources. They are most commonly held at 8:00-8:30pm.</p>
<p>​			▾	CCC and USACO preparation and attending (6 meetings)</p>

        alt="image-20200609172154169_copy"/></p>
<p>​				•	Unfortunately, CCC was withheld from attending due to COVID-19, but the USACO meetings were held 2 days before and at the date of the contest. And the USACO holds a total of 3 intermediate contests at December, January, and February. The specific dates are <strong>14&amp;16th December, 18&amp;20th January, and 21&amp;24th February</strong>. The attending of these six meetings are limited, because of the difficult nature of the USACO contest. Specifically, <strong>Dazhi, Marin, and Jason.</strong> These meetings are held in Istudy, in private (sofa area), and after the quarantine in zoom, often 8 or 9 in the evening.</p>
<p>​		▾	Tutoring and meetings (20+ meetings)</p>
<p>​			▾	Overview</p>
<p>​				•	Because HFIP (as mentioned above) is not exactly an exam-oriented club, we love to develop amazing and beautiful websites and programs that benefit people. Yet, with many newcomers, we have a tutoring program that helps each person learn while developing, and as they have developed a full-blown website, they would have already known a huge amount of knowledge on programming.</p>
<p>​				•	Under this philosophy, we hold meetings that consist of equal amounts of tutoring and project development.</p>
<p>​			▾	Web dev and Arduino tutoring (15 meetings)</p>

        alt="1381577115548_.pic1_copy"/></p>
<p>​				•	During the span from August to December, there were a total of 15 weekly lectures held. The dates are: <strong>16,22,29 August, 5,21,26 September, 11,17,31 October, 6,13 November, 17,18,19,21 December.</strong></p>
<p>​				•	Attendance are mainly split into two groups, in an more advanced meeting, the only required personnel are Dazhi, Marin and Jason, but in other lectures that intend to teach, the attendance is for all main memebers.</p>
<p>​				▾	In the 1,4,5,15 meetings the attending people are :</p>
<p>​					•	钟达之Dazhi 陈志聪Marin 刘睿臻Jason</p>
<p>​				▾	In the rest, attending people are:</p>
<p>​					•	Bob 杨文博，Cecilia 熊子琦，Charlie 张唯嘉，Elaina 邵怡然，Mike 陈子昊，Peter 江昊，Wendy 吴卓仪，Wesley赵鹏</p>
<p>​				•	Only one person has consistent late/absent issues, which is Bill 何传志, but others are 90% attending.</p>
<p>​				•	These lectures, by which I mean the less advanced ones, are mainly split into WebDev and Arduino. In web dev, the students learn how to develop websites using python, and learning python skills on the way. During the lectures, the students shown great improvements in their skills and are able to build their own responsive, and back-end-supported websites. In Arduino, which is a newly found common interest, many people showed passion towards the subject. Though further plans for it were stopped by the quarantine, it is has been a great success during the few classes that have been taken, and we plan to focus more next year.</p>
<p>​			▾	Online Java (5 meetings)</p>

<p>​				•	Due to difficulties the quarantine, many plans were canceled. However, we managed to make the most out of this challenging times with online-taught classes. During this time, we mainly focused on meetings that are oriented towards tests and competitions. But to better orient the members of HFIP to next year&rsquo;s AP CS class, we held a total of 5 online Java Classes that focused on <strong>java basics, java OOP development, java algorithms 1&amp; 2, and java common classes.</strong> Held on dates: <strong>6,8,13,15,20 April.</strong> Although the attendance was not the best, there were still a solid of 6-7 people attending, <strong>Marin, Jason, Dazhi, Bill,</strong> <strong>Bob, and Mike,</strong> being the main people and most consistent.</p>
<p>​		▾	Website project development (150+ man hours)</p>
<p>​			▾	Overview</p>
<p>​				•	As stated above, many websites were developed as a group effort, and many have shown tremendous results. I believe that this method of managingg devlopments would grow to become better next year.</p>
<p>​				•	The split-and-conquer method has worked out this year, and through continuous improvement, I believe it would work out net year as well.</p>
<p>​				•	Again, we would like to emphasis that software development is not simply a meeting-and-finish structure, and requires continuous input and effort. Thus, we record in estimated man hours.</p>

<p>​				•	During <strong>September 9 - 21</strong>, we developed an Online Financial Contest Backend for the HFI Financial Club.</p>
<p>​				•	This site was not only assigned to us for only development, but we were also major agents in discussing, passing, and creating ideas for the contest itself. In which, we placed a huge amount of work to assure that there was a functional and easy-to use bidding, marketing, trading, exchange system. In addition to a solid financial basis for the website, we also spent a huge amount of hours to refine its ui, and make many things like the posting of information, logging in, and editing specific details simple.</p>

<p>​				•	The development period is <strong>March 8 - April 20</strong>, main contributors are <strong>Dazhi, Marin, and Bill, and Charlie.</strong></p>
<p>​				•	This was designed to make more people wake up earlier in the morning. You can be able to log your name on the activity logger, and the earliest person would have a golden crown, the second a silver, and third a bronze. By incentivizing more people to sign up and say wacky things on the website, we could allow more people to be more productive in the morning.</p>

<p>​				•	The development period is <strong>December 21 to March 7</strong>, main contributors are <strong>Mike, Jason, and Dazhi.</strong></p>
<p>​				•	The creation of this website was because of a widespread unsuitableness of modern to-do apps to meet an audience of increasingly lowering attention span nowadays. Thus, Mike, Jason and I set up to a journey to create an webapp that allowed people to be focusing on one thing per time. Thus, they would need to divert attention elsewhere.</p>
