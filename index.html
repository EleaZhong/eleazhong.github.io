Officers were seen pushing and using their batons with some even punching and grabbing protesters as they approached the line of police.
People were scattered between three areas &ndash; Parliament Square, Whitehall and Downing Street &ndash; while protesters could be seen in videos on social media climbing walls, statues and traffic lights.
This comes as activists** **filled public spaces in huge numbers for the second consecutive weekend to commemorate the death of George Floyd and demand an end to systemic racism &ndash; staging &ldquo;die-ins&rdquo; outside US embassies and even tearing down a statue of a former slave trader in the British town of Bristol.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p><span class="note imgs"><img class="img" src="/againstuff/200607162229-london-protest-0706-exlarge-169.jpg" alt /></span></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/interview/">

It now transpires that
following legal action by several movie industry groups, a Paris court handed down a ruling ordering some of the country&rsquo;s top ISPs to prevent their customers from accessing around 36 platforms.
In common with at least 30 countries all around the world, France is becoming ever more receptive of site-blocking as a means to mitigate copyright infringement.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/ungoogled-chromium/">

Help is welcome! See the docs/contributing.md document for more information.
Objectives In descending order of significance (i.e. most important objective first):
 ungoogled-chromium is Google Chromium, sans dependency on Google web services. ungoogled-chromium retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible. Unlike other Chromium forks that have their own visions of a web browser, ungoogled-chromium is essentially a drop-in replacement for Chromium.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/minicouchdb-in-rust/">
            <p class="note title">MiniCouchDB in Rust</p><p class="note date">Monday, June 8, 2020</p><p class="note content">Waterbuffalo Posts - Recently we had a Hack Week, where we could work on anything we liked for the week. Since I’m enjoying programming in Rust, I took some inspiration from mini-redis and tried to build a mini-CouchDB in Rust.
In case you don’t know, the next big release of CouchDB, version 4.x, will be built on top of FoundationDB (FDB). FoundationDB is a distributed, transactional Key/Value store. For this hack week, I decided to follow the design of CouchDB implemented on FoundationDB and see if I could get my Rust implementation to read the data that CouchDB stores in FoundationDB.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/zettelkasten-note-taking-in-10-minutes/">

Zettelkasten aka slip-box note-taking is the new cool kid on the block. Don’t go down the same rabbit hole as I did, researching the method for tens of hours. This article should be enough of the introduction to get you started.
Why Slip-box method promises to prevent your notes from piling up deep within your note-taking app and being forgotten. Instead, using this method will improve the value of your notes as you create more of them.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/dino/">

One of the things we, humans, are particularly good at is classifying songs. In just a few seconds we can tell whether we’re listening to Classical music, Rap, Blues or EDM. However, as simple as this task is for us, millions of people still live with unclassifed digital music libraries.
The average library is estimated to have about 7,160 songs. If it takes 3 seconds to classify a song (either by listening or because you already know), a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation gives around 6 hours to classify them all.<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p><span class="note imgs"><img class="img" src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*_SLyjgV6vspBMD_w-lfFvQ.gif" alt /><img class="img" src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*nU9v9AQFJm0YwBv2-5DkXQ.jpeg" alt /></span></a></li><li class="item"><a class="note" href="/news/hackernoon1/">

If you need a 20 kg hammer to drive a nail, you just take it. The same story with the node_modules, it may weight a few kilobytes or a few megabytes because our imaginary hammer comes with a set of heavy nails, right?<span class="mldr">&mldr;</span></p></a></li></ul><div class="pagination">
